Checked Exceptions in Java:
---------------------------
These are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. If some code within a method throws a checked exception, then the method must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using the throws keyword. In checked exceptions, there are two types: fully checked and partially checked exceptions. A fully checked exception is a checked exception where all its child classes are also checked, like IOException, and InterruptedException. A partially checked exception is a checked exception where some of its child classes are unchecked, like an Exception.


Unchecked Exceptions in Java:
-----------------------------
These are the exceptions that are not checked at compile time. In C++, all exceptions are unchecked, so it is not forced by the compilerâ€™s to either handle or specify the exception. It is up to the programmers to be civilized and specify or catch the exceptions. In Java, exceptions under Error and RuntimeException classes are unchecked exceptions, everything else under throwable is checked.
