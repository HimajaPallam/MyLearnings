Agile project management is a process for managing a project that involves constant collaboration and working in iterations. 


Rapid progress: By effectively reducing the time it takes to complete various stages of a project, teams can elicit feedback in real time and produce working prototypes or demos throughout the process
Customer and stakeholder alignment: Through focusing on customer concerns and stakeholder feedback, the Agile team is well positioned to produce results that satisfy the right people
Continuous improvement: As an iterative approach, Agile project management allows teams to chip away at tasks until they reach the best end result

Agile frameworks:
Scrum: It is ideal for projects with rapidly changing requirements, using short sprints. Principle-based project management
Kanban: It visualizes project progress and is great for tasks requiring steady output.; Visual workflows and processes
Scrumban: Hybrid of Scrum and Kanban
Lean: It streamlines processes, eliminating waste for customer value.

Every Agile framework emphasizes a degree of adaptability, breaking projects into phases and embracing changing requirements.
Through iterations and incremental efforts, they incorporate collaboration and customer feedback, leading to continuous improvement.


What are some of the responsibilities of an Agile team?

Self-organization: One of the cornerstones of an Agile team is the ability to self-organize. In Agile project management, the onus is on individual team members and teams to take initiative and organize themselves in a way that will lead to the highest output.
Cross-functional collaboration: Going hand in hand with the need for self-organization is the Agile demand for cross-functional collaboration. Agile teams have to relay information across departments and be able to work closely with a range of colleagues.
Iteration planning: Specific to Agile project management, iteration planning requires team members to outline the scope of individual sprints according to the product backlog.


There are various ways to effectively track progress and measure success with Agile projects:

Daily standups: Brief meetings to discuss obstacles and find solutions
Sprint reviews: Informal sit-down meetings to present work and solicit team feedback
Retrospectives: Reflections on past work to inspire and influence future progress
