Agile:
Iterative Development: Agile development follows an iterative approach, where small increments of functionality are developed in short timeframes called iterations or sprints. Each iteration typically lasts two to four weeks, allowing for continuous feedback and frequent releases.

User Stories: Agile teams use user stories to capture requirements from the perspective of end-users. User stories are concise, non-technical descriptions of a feature or functionality that provide a clear understanding of what needs to be developed.

Cross-Functional Teams: Agile teams are typically cross-functional, composed of developers, testers, designers, and other necessary roles. This structure enables better collaboration and collective ownership of the product.

Backlog and Prioritization: The development work is managed through a backlog, a prioritized list of user stories and tasks. The team collaborates with stakeholders to prioritize items based on business value, complexity, and customer needs.

Scrum or Kanban Frameworks: Agile development is often implemented using Scrum or Kanban frameworks. Scrum divides work into fixed-length sprints, while Kanban provides a more continuous flow of work.

Retrospectives: Agile teams regularly conduct retrospectives at the end of each sprint to reflect on the process and identify areas for improvement. These feedback loops help the team continuously improve their development practices.

Sprint Planning Meeting:
The Sprint Planning Meeting marks the beginning of the sprint. The Product Owner collaborates with the Development Team to determine which Product Backlog items will be worked on during the sprint. The team selects a set of user stories or tasks from the Product Backlog and commits to achieving the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Planning Meeting typically has two parts: the first part is focused on what will be done in the sprint (what user stories to work on), and the second part is focused on how the work will be done (defining the tasks).

Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up):
The Daily Scrum is a short and time-boxed meeting that occurs every day during the sprint.
The Development Team gathers to synchronize and discuss progress and plan for the day. Each team member answers three questions:

What did I do yesterday?
What will I do today?
Are there any impediments blocking my progress?

Sprint Review (Sprint Demo):
The Sprint Review takes place at the end of the sprint and is an opportunity for the Development Team to present the completed work to the stakeholders, including the Product Owner and any other interested parties.

Sprint Retrospective:
The Sprint Retrospective is also held at the end of the sprint. The Scrum Team reflects on the past sprint, identifies what went well and what could be improved, and discusses action items for continuous improvement

Agile project management is a process for managing a project that involves constant collaboration and working in iterations. 


Rapid progress: By effectively reducing the time it takes to complete various stages of a project, teams can elicit feedback in real time and produce working prototypes or demos throughout the process
Customer and stakeholder alignment: Through focusing on customer concerns and stakeholder feedback, the Agile team is well positioned to produce results that satisfy the right people
Continuous improvement: As an iterative approach, Agile project management allows teams to chip away at tasks until they reach the best end result

Agile frameworks:
Scrum: It is ideal for projects with rapidly changing requirements, using short sprints. Principle-based project management
Kanban: It visualizes project progress and is great for tasks requiring steady output.; Visual workflows and processes
Scrumban: Hybrid of Scrum and Kanban
Lean: It streamlines processes, eliminating waste for customer value.

Every Agile framework emphasizes a degree of adaptability, breaking projects into phases and embracing changing requirements.
Through iterations and incremental efforts, they incorporate collaboration and customer feedback, leading to continuous improvement.


What are some of the responsibilities of an Agile team?

Self-organization: One of the cornerstones of an Agile team is the ability to self-organize. In Agile project management, the onus is on individual team members and teams to take initiative and organize themselves in a way that will lead to the highest output.
Cross-functional collaboration: Going hand in hand with the need for self-organization is the Agile demand for cross-functional collaboration. Agile teams have to relay information across departments and be able to work closely with a range of colleagues.
Iteration planning: Specific to Agile project management, iteration planning requires team members to outline the scope of individual sprints according to the product backlog.


There are various ways to effectively track progress and measure success with Agile projects:

Daily standups: Brief meetings to discuss obstacles and find solutions
Sprint reviews: Informal sit-down meetings to present work and solicit team feedback
Retrospectives: Reflections on past work to inspire and influence future progress


Scrum or Kanban Frameworks: The Agile process can be implemented using Scrum or Kanban frameworks. Scrum is well-suited for teams that prefer fixed-length iterations and strict roles, while Kanban offers a more continuous flow of work and is adaptable to changing priorities.
